          IMAX is an exciting meeting place where you can turn your meeting into an experience. Take
          advantage of the bio effect and let your message get bigger impact with large picture and
          sound formats. At the cinema you can hold anything from large congresses and general
          meetings to smaller breakfast meetings and family events. Invite your customers to
          exclusive movie events and product launches or your colleagues at a nice kick-off and
          conference. The freedom of choice is great and that is why we have made it easier for you
          by putting together meeting packages containing our most popular meeting options. So sit
          back and get inspired for your next meeting and event!
